# Open API Examples
This repository contains Open API specs and examples for Slim AI API
It is broken down by service, such as workspace with the following structure:

```

├── openapi.yaml
├── <language examples

```

These example have a generate.sh script that gives sample options to use for the open API generator.

For mac, brew install openapi-generator
