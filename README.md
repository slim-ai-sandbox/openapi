# Open API Examples
This repository contains Open API specs and examples for Slim AI API

This work is Beta.  It is actively under development and subject to change.  

The sample code is exactly that, sample code.  It is NOT intended to be production ready code.  It is intended to be a starting point for your development.
It is broken down by service, such as workspace with the following structure:

```
<service name>
├── openapi.yaml
├── <language examples

```

These example have a generate.sh script that gives sample options to use for the open API generator.

For mac, brew install openapi-generator

Run the generate.sh script to generate the code for the language of your choice.
THe provided samples assume the generator has been run.
